Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered from the NICHD community and are used to initiate Ecosystem efforts.

# S42:  	As a researcher, I want to access, link, share, and use data from multiple research and administrative data sources (such as CDC NHANES, SAMHSA NSDUH, NIH/NIDA MTF, and ACF AFCARS) so I can study the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children and determine whether related outcomes are more severe for children in foster care.

Itâ€™s difficult to extract this information and understand how these rules intersect.  |  My goal is to understand whether certain datasets can be linked, and if so, what rules and controls apply to the resulting linked dataset so I can appropriately share and use the linked data to study pediatric COVID.
