Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

| As NIH staff, I want to fund research about the genetic underpinnings of COVID symptoms in children, but I want to avoid paying for duplicate whole genome sequencing for children who have already been sequenced in other studies | We have limited funds to pay for sequencing and without knowing which participants are the same, we are likely to inadvertently pay for whole genome sequencing the same child multiple times | My goal is to enable participant-level linkage in children across multiple studies and data repositories   | NICHD Staff | Medium - I can work around this but it is unpleasant | CARING for Children with COVID (https://caring4kidswithcovid.nih.gov/)
