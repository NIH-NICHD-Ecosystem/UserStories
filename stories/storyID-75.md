Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered from the NICHD community and are used to initiate Ecosystem efforts.

| As a researcher, I want to use GenAI to run statistical analysis on genetic, clinical, and other health data from a controlled access data repository and generate graphs and other visuals. | This requires entering the data into the tool, but I am not sure this is allowed  | My goal is to understand how GenAI companies handle data input into their tools to determine whether this conflicts with the provisions of my data use agreement
