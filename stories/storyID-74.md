Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered from the NICHD community and are used to initiate Ecosystem efforts.

# S74: As a researcher, I want to predict which participants in my study are most likely to benefit from a given drug based on their genetics (from whole genome sequencing), clinical records (from electronic health records), and other health information (from questionnaires).

| As a researcher, I want to predict which participants in my study are most likely to benefit from a given drug based on their genetics (from whole genome sequencing), clinical records (from electronic health records), and other health information (from questionnaires). | I would like to enter the data about these participants into a public GenAI tool to jump-start my analysis, but I am not sure this is allowed | My goal is to understand how GenAI companies handle data input into their tools to determine whether this conflicts with legal or IRB requirements or what the participants agreed to in the consent form
