Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

# S72: As the NICHD Office of Data Science and Sharing, we want to distinguish real from perceived barriers to researchers' data science and sharing goals so we can develop resources that solve real challenges

| User Story | Current Problem | User Goal
| :------------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| What does the user want to be able to do? | Why can't the user do this today? | What's the user's ultimate goal? 
| As the NICHD Office of Data Science and Sharing, we want to understand current researcher data sharing and data science practices so we can develop strategies and resources to improve practices as needed | Today we lack visibility into the day-to-day data practices of NICHD researchers    | Our goal is to promote data sharing and data science best practices that align with the vision of the NICHD Data Ecosystem and NIH, HHS and other federal policies and frameworks
