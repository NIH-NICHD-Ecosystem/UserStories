Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

# S3: As NICHD staff, I want to be able to update a given field in the Data Repository Finder and track the date and reason for  the change, so that I can go back later and review why that decisions was made
