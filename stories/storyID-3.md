Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered from the NICHD community and are used to initiate Ecosystem efforts.

| As NICHD staff, I want to be able to update a given field in the Data Repository Finder and track the  date and reason for  the change, so that I can go back later and review why that decision was made| DRF registration system does not yet support tracking changes | My goal is to track the provenance of edits made to the DRF and to document why the changes were made.
